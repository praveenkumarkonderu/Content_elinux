Tool Chains:

Build  -> The machine where the tool chain is build or created 
						or 
		  Machine building the tool chain
		  
Host   -> The Machine where the tool chain is used to build target application 
						or
		  Machine where tool chain is running

Target -> The Mahcine where the target applcation which is build by toolchain is running

Native Toolchain 

        Condition: build == host == target (Ex:GCC)

        Built and used on the same machine; useful for updated components on the same architecture.

Cross Toolchain

        Condition: build == host != target

        Built and run on the build/host machine, but outputs code for a different target machine.

Cross-Native Toolchain

        Condition: build != host == target

        Built on one machine (build), runs on another (host), but targets the host's own architecture; useful for porting or when build machine is much faster.

Canadian Cross Toolchain

        Condition: build != host != target

        Built on one machine, runs on a second machine, targets a third; used when the build environment is different from both the host and target (often for efficiency or flexibility).
